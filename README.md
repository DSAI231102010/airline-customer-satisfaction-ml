# Airline Customer Satisfaction & Flight Delay Prediction (ML)

## Overview
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to an airline passenger dataset to predict:
- Customer Satisfaction (Satisfied / Neutral / Dissatisfied)
- Flight Status (On-Time vs Delayed)

The objective is to understand how service quality, passenger experience, and operational factors influence customer satisfaction and flight delays.

## Dataset
Airline passenger dataset containing customer demographics, flight details, and service ratings.

> **Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to size/licensing limitations. Please use the original dataset source.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Classification model training
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results & Insights
The trained models demonstrated reliable performance in identifying key factors affecting customer satisfaction and flight delays.  
The analysis highlights the impact of service quality and operational variables on passenger experience.

## Broader Impact
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be applied to real-world airline data to support improvements in customer experience, service quality, and operational planning.
